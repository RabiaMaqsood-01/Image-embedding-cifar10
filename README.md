## Image-Embedding-through-CNN-Models-and-Stacking-Ensemble
Optimizing universal image embeddings for image similarity using various deep CNN models and Stacking Ensemble Technique.

This project explores the use of three deep CNN models (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) to extract image embeddings from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The models are evaluated using the mAP@5 metric to measure their performance. Fine-tuning and hyperparameter tuning are applied to further enhance the model performance. To improve embedding extraction, a Stacking Ensemble Technique is implemented, combining the strengths of the individual models. K-Means clustering visualizes the embedding clusters generated by each model, and KNN is employed to retrieve and display similar images based on the embeddings.
### Objectives
```
•	To evaluate the performance of DenseNet 121, ResNet 50, and VGG 16 models for image embedding across diverse visual domains.
•	To Assess the effectiveness of K-nearest neighbors algorithm in measuring image similarity using embeddings.
•	To Examine the performance of MAP@5 metric in evaluating the performance of image embedding models.
•	Explore the enhancement of model performance through the utilization of Stacking Ensemble Technique in image embedding task.
•	Investigate the effects of fine-tuning and hyperparameter tuning on the performance of deep CNN models and stacking ensemble technique.
